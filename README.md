In this work, we have investigated the clustering process in practical gene expression datasets using K-Means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) methods. K-Means and SOM methods work better on the dataset. However, the gene expression data must be preprocessed before clustering them as seen in our results.
